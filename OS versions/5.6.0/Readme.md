# Running OS 5.6

With the introduction of OS 5.6 in TI-84 Plus CE calculators, ASM programs have been disabled as a result of TI intervention. The program and in-built shell arTIfiCE has been included as it results in the ability to jailbreak the calculator via the CabriJr app.

More info on the removal of ASM and C programs may be found [here](https://www.cemetech.net/news/2020/5/950/_/ti-83-premium-ceti-84-plus-ce-asmc-removal-updates).

Info on how to run arTIfiCE can be found [here](https://www.cemetech.net/news/2020/5/950/_/ti-83-premium-ceti-84-plus-ce-asmc-removal-updates).

It is recommended to install Cesium via arTIfiCE at which point Cesium may be used to run the programs.
