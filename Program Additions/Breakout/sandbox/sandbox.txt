The same level file will work on both the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition and TI-84
Plus CE.  You must have version 1004 or higher of CMonster on your calculator
to use these external levels.  This file contains 8 levels.  The external
level file can be used from either RAM or archive.  To play the external
levels, run CMonster as usual and press APPS to open the level selection menu.
