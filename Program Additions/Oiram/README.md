# Oiram - Level Packs

Oiram allows for level packs to be added relatively simply. To install level packs, you merely add the level pack to the calculator. To remove the level pack, you just delete it from memory, found in the AppVars location.

Due to the large selection of packs, only a few have been placed within the "- All Files" folder. As of such, there are many which may still be good to add.
