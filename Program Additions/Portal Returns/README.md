# Portal Returns CE - Level Packs and Textures

## Level Packs

### Install Instructions
When installing level packs to Portal, there are three available options for names: Portal1P, Portal2P and Portal3P. When installing the source level pack, this may overwrite an existing one. Therefore to avoid this, you may want to install one of the available PORTAL1P, etc, packs found inside the "Pack No. Specific" folder found in each level pack.

### Editing Level Packs
Packs may be edited or copied using the PortalED program. It is recommended to read the README file located within the Portal Install Folder (Located in the "Other" folder).

## Installing/Uninstalling Textures
When you install a texture, the PortalCP AppVar is overwritten, therefore replacing the previous textures. To uninstall the existing pack, delete the PortalCP AppVar and the default textures will be created next time you open Portal.

### Creating Texture Packs
Instructions relating to the creation of your own texture packs may be found within the Portal Install Folder.
