+ DTTWT

- Don't Touch The White Tiles, ported to your TI-84+CE!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- ABOUT
	Don't Touch The White Tiles is a simple game, but it can be very hard to master. Countless of apps and other iterations of this simple
	piano-game have been made, and I felt like it was my time to contribute to this utter madness. The game involves several modes for you to
	play, with varying difficulty and perhaps some rage-inducing moments. Play this game with your friends to see who can get the highest
	Hi-Score, and, of course, enjoy!

- INSTALLING AND RUNNING
	1. Download and install the TI Connect™ CE Software from https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw
	2. Connect your TI-84+CE to your computer using the micro-usb cable, included with your calculator at purchase.
	3. Transfer DTTWT.8xp to your calculator using TI Connect™ CE.
	4. To run the game on you calculator, search the token "Asm(" from [catalog], "prgmDTTWT" from [prgm], and run the command "Asm(prgmDTTWT". (If you have OS 5.3 or higher, you can omit the "Asm(" token)
