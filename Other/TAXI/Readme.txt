Taxi Simulator
by commandblockguy

You are a taxi driver.
The arrow buttons control turns.
Don't turn too soon or too late, or you will crash.
Pick up passengers and drop them off at their destination, marked by a green circle.
Passengers will pay more the quicker you drop them off. If you take too long, you won't get any tip at all!
Traffic is indicated by the roads with red lines. It will slow you down, so don't get stuck!

To install, send TAXI.8xp to your TI-84 Plus CE using TI-Connect CE.
You will also need the C libraries if you have not installed them on the calc already.
They can be found here: http:///tiny.cc/clibs

To run, you will need to use Asm( from the catalogue menu (2nd + 0)
Next, select TAXI from the "prgm" menu and press enter.
A shell like Cesium can be used to run the program without needing to find Asm( every time.
