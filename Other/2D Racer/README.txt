installation:
Copy all files inside the Background Folder and the Vehincles folder onto the TI84 CE calculator.
Then copy Race2D onto the calc and run it.
If you want to create yur own vehincles, run TICREATE.exe, go to advanced, open the Vehincles Tab, change properties like speed, provide an Image in a suitable resolution (up to 256*256 or 64kb), and click "Create". Then copy the Outputfile to the calculator.

If you want to save space, you can transfer not all vehincle files to the calculator or transfer only one backgroundfile.
