Independent C Project #7 -- SCOGGERC - LIBS ReadME
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You made sure you read the Readme.txt in the main folder, right?

These libraries are provided as a convenience if you either don't have
them loaded to your calculator, or if LibLoad complains about the
current version of the libraries you do have on your calculator.
