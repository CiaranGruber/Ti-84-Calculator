About
------------------------------------------
This is a reaction based game. You must open the switches and allow trains to pass through before they crash into them. 
There are four gamemodes, Campaign, Endless, and Bullet.
In campaign mode, whenever you open a switch for a train, you make money. If you let a train through without opening a switch, the train crashes and you lose money.
Endless mode just goes on forever, and you try to beat your highscore.
Bullet mode is exactly the same as endless, just without multiple trains and much faster.

Installation
------------------------------------------
Send SWITCHOP.8xp to your calculator using TI-Connect CE or TiLP.
Make sure you have the latest version of the C libraries - https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases/
Run it with Asm(prgmSWITCHOP on the homescreen, or install Cesium to run it - https://www.cemetech.net/programs/index.php?mode=file&id=1372

Gameplay
------------------------------------------    
   Menu:
      - You can press [Graph] to toggle the story when starting campaign, and use the Arrow Keys to Select a gamemode.
   Campaign Mode:
      - You have a balance that starts at $10
      - Whenever you open a switch for a train, you get anywhere from 1-10 dollars, depending on the upgrade you have.
      - If you let a train through, you lose anywhere from 15-7 dollars.
      - You use the money you make to upgrade your system and get pay raises. You can make trains go slower, make more money per train, have switches open for longer, and make switches automatic. Once you have automatic switches, you win the game.
      - You can reset on the upgrades screen with [Alpha]
      - If you end up with no money, you lose and have to start over.
   Endless Mode:
      - This is just the base game. If you let a train through with a switch open, you get a point, if you don't open a switch for a train, you lose. 
      - If you get far enough, you will have to open switches for multiple trains.
      - Try to beat your highscore!
   Bullet Mode:
      - This mode is an extension of Endless, just 2-3 times faster, and without multiple trains.
