This program will convert your old WAVERHS appvar to the new WAVERDAT appvar. Note that only there are some new settings 
and statistics options, so this isn't perfect. Here's what you will retain from 1.0:
-your highscore
-your colors
-your selection for "opening animation"
-your selection for "show FPS meter"
To run, select WAVERCNV from the program menu or from your favorite shell, run it, and it'll do the rest. 

Changelog
=========

1.0- First release...
