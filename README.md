Instructions may be found either in the program or if not, navigate to the "Other" folder, find the game and read the Readme file if available. If neither is there, try playing around with controls to learn them.

### Programs not to be run
Some programs are parts of other programs and are not designed to be run as standalone apps. While these usually don't affect the calculator, it is best to leave these alone.

## Additions to Programs
Various programs allow for the addition of level packs or textures to be added to their default functionality. Each of these is explained within each program part found in the "Program Additions" folder.

## Archiving/Deletion of apps
If your calculator starts to run out of RAM, you may need to archive some apps, moving their location from RAM to storage
This can be done using the following steps:

Note: If uninstalling programs, many will have AppVars used to hold highscores, progress, etc. Usually these are relatively small and should not be deleted in case the program is installed again. However there are also many AppVars used to store different parts of a program and is not related to any save states. These are usually quite high in terms of size and may be deleted without repercussions should the game be installed again.
