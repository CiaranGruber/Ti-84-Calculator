* The latest TI-84 Plus CE OS (see above for link)

## App/OS Installation
In order to install the apps, you must have TI Connect open and have the calculator connected with the cable to your computer
Once you have selected your app (by opening a folder), you must drag the app from Windows Explorer into the calculator shown in the "Connected Calculators" section of TI Connect.

Other apps can be found by searching "TI-84 Plus CE apps" on the internet and several should come up
Note: Some apps may not work on the calculator as they were designed for other versions of the TI-84

## Using the Apps
1. Press the \[prgm] button found in the middle of the calculator
2. Select your program using the arrows
3. Press \[enter] twice to use the program

Further instructions should either be in the program or should be somewhat intuitive

## Archiving/Deletion of apps
If your calculator starts to run out of ram, you may need to archive some apps, moving their location from RAM to storage
This can be done using the following steps
1. Press \[2nd]\[+(/mem)]
2. Select "2:Mem Management/Delete"
3. Select "7:Prgm..."
4. To switch between archive (ARC) and RAM, press the enter button while hovering on the program
5. To delete programs, press the \[del] button while hovering

Notes:
* If you are running out of space, it may be recommended to delete some **unused** apps by replacing step 3 with "Select "A:Apps..."
* You may replace step 3 and go into "1:All" to access the entire storage and delete other unused AppVars and other variables left behind however this is not recommended unless you know exactly what you are deleting
