Other apps can be found by searching "TI-84 Plus CE apps" on the internet and several should come up
Note: Some apps may not work on the calculator as they were designed for other versions of the TI-84

### App Naming
Various apps may have unusual names that would benefit from being changed. The following are recommendations:
* AGD -> GEODASH
* SPAZE -> INVADERS
* CMONSTER -> BREAKOUT
* OIRAM -> MARIO
* ZMBCHS -> ZOMBCHS

### Apps not included
Due to various reasons, several apps have not been included in the "All Files" folder. These may be due to large sizes, perceived low-quality or due to a large amount of customisation in terms of app install

#### Large sizes
Programs >100KB have not been included in the "All Files" folder due to large sizes in which it may be preferable to individually choose its relevance to the games you wish to play. Note: Oiram/Mario has not been included in this selection
* BejeweledCE
* Colossal Cave Adventure

#### Extensive Customisation
* TI-Boy
* 2D Racer

#### Low-quality
* SwipeCE
* Minecraft 2D (More a proof-of-concept program)

## Using the Apps
1. Press the \[prgm] button found in the middle of the calculator
2. Select your program using the arrows
3. Press \[enter] twice to use the program

Instructions may be found either in the program or if not, navigate to the "Other" folder, find the game and read the Readme file if available. If neither is there, try playing around with controls to learn them.
Cesium is an application, however the installer is found as a program and is included in the standard installation ("All Files" folder). It is recommended to read the Readme before opening.

### Bugs
* In Game of Life, the program will only run once. Once it runs, it generates a corrupted save file that you must delete in order to play again

## Archiving/Deletion of apps
If your calculator starts to run out of RAM, you may need to archive some apps, moving their location from RAM to storage
This can be done using the following steps:
1. Press \[2nd]\[+(/mem)]
2. Select "2:Mem Management/Delete"
3. Select "1:All..."
4. To switch between archive (ARC) and RAM, press the enter button while hovering on the program
5. To delete programs, press the \[del] button while hovering

Alternatively, if the Cesium application has been installed, it is recommended to do this as the process is more intuitive and easier to do.

Note: If uninstalling programs, many will have AppVars used to hold highscores, progress, etc. Usually these are relatively small and should not be deleted in case the program is installed again. However there are also many AppVars used to store different parts of a program and is not related to any save states. These are usually quite high in terms of size and may be deleted without repercussions should the game be installed again.
