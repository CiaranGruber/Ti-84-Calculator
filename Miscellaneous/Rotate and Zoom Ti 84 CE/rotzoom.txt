This is a simple "demo" of rotating/zooming a 16-color image on the calculator.
It runs full screen at about 16 frames per second.

This is a plain asm program.  You can transfer it to the calculator by sending
the ROTZOOM.8XP file to your calculator using TI Connect CE (or other software
that communicates with the calculator).  Run it by entering the command 
Asm(prgmROTZOOM on the home screen.  Press CLEAR to exit.

If you are using TI-Connect CE to transfer the game, please note that you
should send the program using the Calculator Explorer section of TI-Connect CE.
The program cannot be opened by the open menu item or in the Program Editor.
