This TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition version of my Dynamic
Recursive Fractal Generator takes advantage of the new
calculator's bigger color screen to generate more detailed,
colorful fractals. It now renders faster and more accurately,
and you can cleanly escape by pressing any key. Simply enter
a coefficient for the fractal, sit back, and enjoy.
