Version 1.1

This is a super simple text viewer for your calculator.
To use it, drag your text files into the "PlaceTextFilesHere" folder.
Then, run the "ConvertToText" batch file. Your converted text files will appear in
the "ConvertedFiles" directory, from where you can use TI-Connect to transfer them
to your calculator.

To run the NOTES program, simply choose the Asm( token from the catalog, and then
select the NOTES program from the [PGRM] menu. It should look like this on the homescreen:

Asm(pgrmNOTES

Then press enter, and enjoy!

Controls:

[UP]/[DOWN] - Move places
[CLEAR] - Return; Quit

NOTES:
The first line of your text file becomes the title of that file on-calc. This is to make titles more descriptive.
