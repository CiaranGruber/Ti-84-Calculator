# TI-84 Plus CE Miscellaneous Programs

Contains a variety of programs used for purposes other than academics or gaming.

## App Renaming
The following programs would benefit from being renamed in order to prevent confusion when selecting programs:
* ZHEDIT -> MEMEDIT
* F1C -> FRACTALS
* TMR -> TIMER

## Apps not in "- All Files" folder

### Low-quality/Specific
* DVD screensaver - While good, it takes up 22KB, large for such a program
* BCEDF EBook Reader - Specific instructions in README (in folder)
* Balloons Screensaver - Basic program with large storage requirements
* Fractals - Fast Fractals, while not including the Sapinski Triangle, is better

### Proof-of-concepts
* Rotate and Zoom
* Bounce
* Instant Messenger - While not technically proof-of-concept, is too difficult to use practically

### Dangerous
The below applications have not been included as they may break the calculator if used incorrectly. Use with caution.
* Advanced Wait State Changer
* Memory Editor - Only known method to stop program is through resetting RAM

## Using Apps

### Programs not to be run
Some programs may be part of other programs and are not designed to be run. These are all that apply:
* ZFRAC1

## Programs made by myself
* Smiling Face Y-vars
* Graph Fixer
