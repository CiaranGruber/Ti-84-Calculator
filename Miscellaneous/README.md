Contains a variety of programs used for purposes other than academics or gaming.

## App Renaming
The following programs would benefit from being renamed in order to prevent confusion when selecting programs:
* ZHEDIT -> MEMEDIT
* F1C -> FRACTALS

## Apps not in "- All Files" folder

## Low-quality/Specific
* DVD screensaver - While good, it takes up 22KB, large for such a program
* BCEDF EBook Reader - Specific instructions in README (in folder)

### Dangerous
The below applications have not been included as they may break the calculator if used incorrectly. Use with caution.
* Advanced Wait State Changer
* Memory Editor - Only known method to stop program is through resetting RAM

## Programs made by myself
