- Library Converter v5.6
- By The Einstein


This is a very handy program that lets you convert programs and
AppVars into each other (boy don't that sound weird), or into
strings. This can be usefull for hiding programs or debugging.

Note: For the TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition only
Requires: DoorsCSE 8.0 or higher, prgmLIBCNVRT, and prgmLIBSHORT


-------------------------------Menu----------------------------------
You will first have to create a password before the program can be
	used (just run it and it will do it for you). This is to
	protect "hidden" programs (ones that have been turned into
	AppVars).
Program -> Appvar: can be BASIC or ASM
AppVar -> Program: can be BASIC or ASM
Rename AppVar: duh
Program/AppVar -> String: I'm not explaining
Hidden programs(AppVars): 5 programs you turned into AppVars will
	show up here; this is for "hiding" and running your hidden
	programs -- you can run them from the separate menu



--When creating a password, ignore the syntax error after creating it

--Keep prgmLIBCNVRT unarchived because it may throw errors at you at
times (you can keep an archived copy of it if you want just in case
the calc resets)

--When converting program to AppVar, the command to run it as a
program will be copied to Str8; just paste it into a program to run
(use [2ND][STO>])

--When converting to a string and pasting Str8 into a program, be
sure to break it up into lines, or else it might not execute properly

--To change password, unarchive prgmLIBCNVRT and go to "Hidden
Programs] menu

--You don't have to input the "rowSwap(" token when typing AppVar
name; it's automatically done

--If a name already exists, you can delete it through the program (it
gives you the option)
