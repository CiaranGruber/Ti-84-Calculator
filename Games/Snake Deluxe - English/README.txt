Notice from developer

I (Epharius) ask that you (the end-user) to make NO modifications to the program, for the simple reason that it is not meant to be modified. Indeed, money, the number of objects and themes must remain unchanged in order for the game to function properly.
If you try to change your money, you will be met with a message telling you something bad...
