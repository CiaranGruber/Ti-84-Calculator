Thank you for downloading my CC21 entry!

To run, launch TI-Connect(tm) CE, plug your TI-84+CE into your computer and drag HOLIDAY.8xp into the “Calculator Explorer” tab, which will show you all of the other files on your calculator. You can then unplug your calculator when the file is done transferring (this should only take a second or two) and run the program from the [prgm] menu. 

If there are any errors during transfer, a helpful video is linked below (by TheLastMillennial, a fellow Cemetech programmer).

Tutorial:
 - Select and execute prgmHOLIDAY from the [prgm] menu. 
 - A title screen should show up. You can press enter (or any key) to continue and view the introduction, or press [sto ->] to skip the intro.
 - A Google Docs-like screen should start drawing in. When it finishes, you can press [enter] to start writing your essay, which will increase your boredom (first bar starting from the left) and your work (second bar).
 - To gain points or decrease boredom, you can press the right arrow key to move to a Sublime Text (it's an excellent text editor for programmers) screen, where you can "write code" by pressing [enter]. You can always move back to the essay-writing screen by pressing the left arrow key.
 - On the essay writing screen, you can go to the shop by pressing the left arrow key. Here, you can spend your points on upgrades by moving your selector up and down and pressing [enter] on upgrades you wish to buy. You can go back to the essay writing screen by pressing the right arrow key.
 - After ten minutes of gameplay (excluding redraw times), your score will be recorded in the leaderboard, where you can compete with your friends! Have fun!
