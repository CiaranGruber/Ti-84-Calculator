<h1>Dinosaur Run CE</h1>

<p>A clone of Google Chrome's dinosaur game (from the no internet screen) for the TI-84 Plus CE graphing calculator.</p>

<h3>Installation:</h3>

<p>Send DINO.8xp to the calculator using TI-Connect CE (for Windows and Mac) or TiLP (for Linux).
Also send <a href="https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases">the C libraries</a> to the calculator.
To run, select DINO from the prgm menu and press enter.</p>

<p>On older calculator OSes, you may need to open the catalog and select the Asm( token before running the program, so that the text <code>Asm(prgmDINO</code> is displayed.
To avoid having to do this, either update your OS or use a shell such as <a href="https://github.com/mateoconlechuga/cesium/releases">Cesium</a>. </p>

<h3>Controls:</h3>

<p>UP to jump, DOWN to duck / fall, enter/2nd to restart, clear to exit.</p>

<h3>Building from source:</h3>

<p>The most up-to-date version of the source code may be found <a href="https://github.com/commandblockguy/dino-run-ce">on GitHub</a>.
To build, you will need to install the <a href="https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/releases">CE toolchain</a>.
Run <code>make</code> in this directory to produce a binary in <code>bin/</code>.</p>

<h3>USB:</h3>

<p>Please note that USB support is still experimental and not recommended.
To build with USB support, use <code>make usb</code> or set USE_USB to 1 in <code>config.h</code>.
You will also need to send the <a href="https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/tree/usbdrvce">USB libraries</a>.
A (probably outdated) prebuilt version can be found <a href="http://commandblockguy.xyz/downloads/usblibs.8xg">here</a>.
You will also need a USB Mini B OTG adapter to use most devices.
Dino Run is compatible with HID boot devices (up/left click to jump, down/right click to jump) and the Steam controller (for rumble sounds).</p>
