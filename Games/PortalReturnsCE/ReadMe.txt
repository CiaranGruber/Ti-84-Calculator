  In-Game Elements

		by standing on them or by placing a cube on them.
Cubes:		Cubes can be picked up by the player by pressing [2ND].
		They are also dropped by pressing [2ND].
Fizzler:	A fizzler is a field through which you cannot shoot
		Portals.  They are blue.
Electric
Field: 		Let's just say you don't want to run into one.
Spikes:		Spikes are much like electric fields, they can 
		lead to injury. But most likely instant death.
Glass:		Weird substance that you can shoot beams through.
High Energy
Pellet:		These things you don't want to touch. You can open
		doors with them though, so they are kind of useful.
		Just guide them with portals into the square block
		buttons.
