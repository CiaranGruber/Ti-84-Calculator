# TI-84 Plus CE Games

This folder contains the vast collection of games available for the TI-84 Plus CE.

## App Renaming
The following programs would benefit from being renamed in order to prevent confusion when selecting programs:
* ADVENT -> CAVEADV (Reduces confusion with ADVENTUR) (Is a part of Colossal Cave Adventure)
* AGD -> GEODASH
* CMONSTER -> BREAKOUT
* CONNECT4 -> CONECT2P (By Martyboyz)
* DTTWT -> WHTETILE
* OIRAM -> MARIO
* SPAZE -> INVADERS
* TETRICA -> TETRIS
* ZMBCHS -> ZOMBCHAS

## Apps not in "- All Files" folder

### Extensive Customisation

### Installing Games
It is recommended to install all games located in the " - All Files" folder followed by any additional applications. Furthermore, many games will require the set of libraries located within the "C-Libraries" folder in order to run.

#### Extra Instructions for specific games

### Instructions for games
While some games provide instructions in the program, it is recommended to read the readme file located with each game

### Bugs/Fixes
* In Game of Life, the program will only run once. Once it runs, it generates a corrupted save file that you must delete in order to play again.
* With various TI-Basic apps, the graph screen may be destroyed somewhat. If this is the case, run GRAPHFIX (In the "Miscellaneous" folder)
