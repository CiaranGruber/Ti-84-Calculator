# TI-84 Plus CE Games

This folder contains the vast collection of games available for the TI-84 Plus CE.

## App Renaming
The following programs would benefit from being renamed in order to prevent confusion when selecting programs:
* AGD -> GEODASH
* SPAZE -> INVADERS
* CMONSTER -> BREAKOUT
* OIRAM -> MARIO
* ZMBCHS -> ZOMBCHAS
* ADVENT -> CAVEADV (Reduces confusion with ADVENTUR) (Is a part of Colossal Cave Adventure)

### Installing Games
It is recommended to install all games located in the " - All Files" folder followed by any additional applications. Furthermore, many games will require the set of libraries located within the "C-Libraries" folder in order to run.

### Instructions for games

### Bugs/Fixes
