TO CREATE A LEVEL VIA TILED :
	- Download and install Tiled, a software that will allow you to create a level from a tileset.
	- In Tiled, create a level with a height of at least 10 tiles, then import the tileset GD.png in the archive (Map -> New Tileset)
	- When you're satisfied, export your level with the .CSV extension
	- Then, go to http://geometrydash.fr.nf and copy/paste the content of the .CSV file in the "data" field. Give it a name, a speed and a difficulty. 
	- If your level has a spaceship or a reversed gravity context, put them in the correct field : at each time you want to change the context, you just have to put the tile numbers of the changes separated by commas (ex : "12,45,48,127" = [12,45[U[48,127[)
	- Once you download the Appvar, upload it into you calculator and.. you're done!
