Thank you for downloading my program!
This is a program for the TI-84+CE and TI-83 CSE, and will not work for other calculators.

The program will generate a string of words for you to type, and will give you a score, based on how fast you can type them.

To add/remove/change the internal word list, you should:
-Go to the “Edit” tab, in the [prgm] menu.
-Scroll down to prgmFASTTYPE, and hit enter.
-Look for the line(s, it may overflow into multiple lines) that has a quote (“), a bunch of random words, followed by ->Str0
-Add/remove words of your choosing.

Note on changing the word list:
-Words can only contain capital letters, and each word should be separated by a space.
-There must be a minimum of ten (10) words, and a maximum of nine hundred and ninety nine (999).


To play the game, launch TI-Connect(tm) CE, plug your TI-84+CE into your computer and drag FASTTYPE.8xp into the “Calculator Explorer” tab, which will show you all of the other files on your calculator. You can then unplug your calculator when the file is done transferring (this should only take a second or two) and launch prgmFASTTYPE. You will then be taken through an explanation of the game and its mechanics, but a more in-depth version and explanation is available in the YouTube video linked below.

If you get a message from TI-Connect(tm) telling you that the file received is of an incompatible version, update to OS 5.2 or higher, as my program uses the TI-BASIC command toString(), which is not available on lower versions. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Enjoy!
