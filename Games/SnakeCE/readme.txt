 --Installation--

Follow the instructions from some other program or guide book.
TiLP or TI Connect CE should work fine.

You also need the latest C Libraries on your calculator, that you can download here:

 https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases/latest

This program requires the libraries:
	GRAPHX
	KEYPADC
	FILEIOC
	LibLoad

 --How to make Snake run--

Shell is recommended.

If you are using a 5.3 os or above, then:
After sending SNAKECE.8xp to your calculator (RAM or ROM):
Press 'prgm', scroll to 'SNAKECE', 'enter', 'enter'.

If you are not using a 5.3 os or above, then:
After sending SNAKECE.8xp to your calculator's RAM:
Press ’2nd’, ’0’, scroll to ‘asm(‘, ’enter’, ‘prgm’, scroll to ‘SNAKECE‘, ’enter’, ’enter’,
And finally, update your os.

Gameplay should be self-explanitory.
On the home, use the keys named before and after each number to change the number.
Press clear during game play to quit, and 2nd pauses game play.
