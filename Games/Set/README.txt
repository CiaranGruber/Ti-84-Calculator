+ SET

- The classic card game Set, ported to your TI-84+CE!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- ABOUT
	Set is a challenging card game for 1+ players. Unfortunately the program only runs on one calculator, so singleplayer it is.
	Game instructions are included in the "HOW TO" page, and are also available anywhere online, if you google "set card game".

- INSTALLING AND RUNNING
	1. Download and install the TI Connect™ CE Software from https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw
	2. Connect your TI-84+CE to your computer using the mini-usb cable, included with your calculator at purchase.
	3. Transfer SET.8xp to your calculator using TI Connect™ CE.
	4. To run the game on you calculator, find the token "Asm(" from [catalog], "prgmSET" from [prgm], and run the command "Asm(prgmSET". (If you have OS 5.3 or higher, you can omit the "Asm(" token)
