# Descent #
###########

Hello! Welcome to Descent Delivery™, the most
technologically advanced delivery service since
Amazon! We're testing out a new technology where
nobody has to be physically inside the facility
to bring the packages to our trucks. They are
instead controlled by you in an adjacent office.
Each package moves until it hits a wall, and you
must take advantage of this to guide the package
to the truck, so it can be safely delivered.
    Good luck. You can do this.

############
# Gameplay #
############

In Descent, you control a box inside a delivery
room, which you can move with LEFT, RIGHT, UP,
and DOWN. It will continue to move in this
direction until it hits a wall. The goal is to
move the box to a delivery truck (represented by
an O with symbols on top of it).

There are three assets that are included that
provide more of a challenge:

*
Spikes: Be careful of these! Moving into one at
high speed will skewer the customer's package!

\  /
Reflectors: The box will bounce off of these in
the direction they face. They can help, or throw
the package off course...

|  -
Collapsers: If the box goes through these, the
blocks to either side will collapse into one.
You will be able to pass these, but only once.

If you find yourself stuck, press MODE to reset.

# Level Editor #
################

DESCEDIT.8xp is the level editor for Descent.
This is a simple and fast way to make custom
levels, which you can play with the CUSTOM LEVEL
option in the menu.

WARNING: It does not have a check to see if the
levels are beatable, but you must have a start
and end point to convert the level.

When you run the editor, you have the option to
load a previously made level, or make a new one.
Move your cursor over a space and press a number
key to place a block. Press DEL to erase blocks.

1 -> Start     ( . )
2 -> End       ( ô )
3 -> Wall      ( # )
4 -> Reflector ( / )
5 -> Collapser ( - )
6 -> Reflector ( \ )
7 -> Collapser ( | )
8 -> Spike     ( * )

After creating a level, press ENTER to export it
to L1. You must then store L1 to a named list,
and once you go into the CUSTOM LEVEL option in
the Descent menu to play it, you must enter the
name of that list.

ADVANCED LEVEL DESIGN: The Descent engine has
checks for many invalid setups (for example, a
reflector leading into a wall, landing parallel
to a collapser, or a wall on the other side of a
collapser) that still make them playable. Try
playing with setups like these, and build levels
around the "invalid" mechanics!
