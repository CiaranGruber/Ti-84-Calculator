 --Features--

1 - Speed Selection

3 - Color selection
4 - High-score save
5 - Awesome Gameplay
6 - Icon
7 - Pause button

 --Installation--

Follow the instructions from some other program or guide book.
TiLP or TI Connect CE should work fine.

You also need the latest C Libraries on your calculator, that you can download here:

 https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases/latest

This program requires the libraries:
	GRAPHX
	KEYPADC
	FILEIOC
	LibLoad

 --How to make SnakeITM run--

Shell is recommended.

If you are using a 5.3 os or above, then:
After sending SNAKEITM.8xp to your calculator (RAM or ROM):
Press 'prgm', scroll to 'SNAKEITM', 'enter', 'enter'.

If you are not using a 5.3 os or above, then:
After sending SNAKEITM.8xp to your calculator's RAM:
Press '2nd', '0', scroll to 'asm(', 'enter', 'prgm', scroll to 'SNAKEITM', 'enter', 'enter',
And finally, update your os.

Gameplay should be self-explanatory.
On the home, use the keys named before and after each number to change the number.
Press clear during game play to quit, and 2nd pauses game play.

I'll let you figure it out… ;)
