DISADVANTAGES:
This is my pokemon game. It is still in development, and please do not be disappointed
if you find it not as good as all the ti-84 plus se games. This is my first real game.
Also, it has no graphics. Also there are no stats - at least in the traditional 
pokemon sense. There's just HP and damage. Also, theres no types or anything really special,
and each attack just does damage. Even if a pokemon uses fly, its just 1-turn, not a 2 turn
move as in real pokemon.


STARTUP
Select PKMN. Don't select PKSWITCH.

You can only use 1 pokemon at a time. Unfortunately, this game would be a lot better if I could use more strings...
