Thanks for downloading Pong 2-Player! I hope you enjoy this program!

I've spent countless hours on this program so a 10/10 rating would make my day!

The Program is pretty self-explanitory.

Running the Program:

If you don't have OS 5.3 or higher (can be checked by [2nd][+][ENTER]), follow this paragraph.
To run the program, go to catalog [2nd][0], scroll down to Asm(,
go to programs [PRGM], scroll to PONG2P then press [ENTER] twice.

If you have OS 5.3 or higher, just run PONG2P like a normal program ([PRGM], scroll down to PONG2P, [ENTER][ENTER]).

Program instructions:

Press the button corresponding to your wishes when you are inside the program. It has a very friendly user-interface.

That's all there's to it! Thanks for downloading and I hope you have fun!
