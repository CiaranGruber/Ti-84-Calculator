Welcome to the new and improved CMonster, one of the first TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition ASM games ever released, now also available for the TI-84 Plus CE and TI-83 Premium CE!  This version adds a new hard mode just in case anyone thought the previous version was too easy (though you can always play on easy mode to get the same experience as before if you can't handle the new difficulty).  In hard mode you will get twice as many points for bricks hit and the victory bonus, but only half as many power-ups will drop.  This version also adds a rotating/zooming graphics display when you win or lose the game.  This effect is unfortunately only available on the TI-83 Premium CE/TI-84 Plus CE version, as the TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition seems to be too slow for it.  Thanks to Kirk Meyer for Lite86 II which is used to compress the game to its ultra-compact size.  Good luck -- you will need it (especially if you are one of the few who dare to try on hard mode and maximum speed)!
