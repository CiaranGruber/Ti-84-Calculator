 -This program is independent and does not need any other programs to function.

Connect 4 is a program that allows 2 players to compete to "Connect 4" first.

Controls:
Left and Right: Select the column you would like to place your piece in.
Enter: Confirm selection marked above chosen column by "*."
On: End program (expect break error).

The turn is marked by a dash next to the player's name on the right side of the screen and by the color of the star above the selected column.

 -Note: This program does not automatically finish after one player has connected a row of four pices.
This is due to a very long wait in between each turn.

Please comment if you notice any bugs within the program.
