DESCRIPTION
This program is very simple: It lets you find coordinates, dimensions and color codes for your CE Textlib rectangles. Because of how CE Textlib works when used in such hackish ways, the coordinates can get very weird so this program can be handy as a reference.

You need CE Textlib to run it. Download it at http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/465/46522.html


CONTROLS
+ - * /: Resize
2nd ALPHA: Change color
CLEAR: Exit (this returns the coordinates and list that can be used with CE Textlib.
F1-F5: Change speed

DISCLAIMERS
Feel free to use the code in this program. Give me credits, though. Also I will not be held responsible for any damage this program could cause to your calculator, yourself or your pet walrus.
